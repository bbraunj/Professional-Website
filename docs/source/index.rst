Experience
==========

| **Software Engineering Intern**
| *Sandia National Laboratories*
| May 2019 -- Present
| Consolidated a group of scattered, project build scripts into one maintainable, reproducible, and unit-tested Python script
| Developed a Python-based shell logger to highlight runtime diagnostics, making obscure build failures simple to debug
| Collaborated with 6 DevOps engineers to restructure a tightly coupled infrastructure with 10,000+ lines across 121 files and 5 directories to a modular, unit-tested system with ~3,000 lines across 5 files and 2 directories
| Created a Python utility that reduced time to set up cloud computing resources for CI/CD pipelines by ~90%
| **Leveraged knowledge** in Python, Linux CLI, Git, Agile Scrum, GitLab, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Unit Testing, DevOps, Containerization, Automation, LaTeX, Microsoft Office, Requirements Analysis, and Software Quality & Maintainability

| **Master's Thesis: Thermal Nozzle**
| *Oklahoma State University*
| Jun 2021 -- Present
| Developing a small-scale jet engine nozzle that uses hot exhaust gas to preheat fuel
| Experimentally evaluating fuel preheat effects on engine efficiency, emissions, maintenance costs, and flame stability
| Leveraged knowledge in Technical Writing, Automation (Macros), Linux, LaTeX, CAD, CFD, Experimental Methods, Excel, Project Management, Research, Jet Engine Cycle Analysis, Thermodynamics, and Heat Transfer

| **Graduate Research Assistant**
| *Pratt & Whitney, Oklahoma State University*
| Aug 2020 -- Present
| Broadly researched theories of fatigue, thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF), plasticity, and material properties
| Constructed low-cycle fatigue test matrix, geometry specifications, and procedures for verification and validation of fatigue models and FEA results
| **Leveraged knowledge** in Research, Fatigue Models, FEA (ANSYS), Excel, Project Management, Experimental Methods, and Python

| **Graduate Research Assistant**
| *Commit Technologies, Oklahoma State University*
| Jun 2021 -- Jul 2021
| Gathered requirements from customer and delivered accurate, mesh independent FEA results for structural analysis
| Reduced computational cost by 60% through restructuring part geometry to use shell elements rather than 3D solid elements
| Leveraged knowledge in FEA (ANSYS), Research, Requirements Analysis, Technical Writing

| **Winner of NASA University Student Design Challenge**
| *USDC-4 Aeronautics Challenge II, Oral Roberts University*
| Sep 2019 -- Apr 2020
| Performed design and analysis of novel cooling methods, thermal systems integration, and propulsion system sizing for a conceptual electrified aircraft propulsion system while maintaining a minimum factor of safety of 2.68
| Achieved fuel savings of 6.4% and decreased overall system weight by approximately 20% compared to NASA’s AGTF30
| Leveraged knowledge in Research, Technical Writing, Thermodynamics, Systems Modeling, and Project Management

| **Honors Research Assistant**
| *Biovista, Oral Roberts University*
| Aug 2018 -- Apr 2019
| Collaborated with a team of engineering students and math/computing professors to explore creative solutions and implement an efficient database system
| Experimented with various large database systems for our partner company’s database of billions of medical journals 
| Leveraged knowledge in Python, SQL-style query language (Cypher), and Linux

| **Lead Machinist**
| *SpaceX Hyperloop Design Challenge, Oral Roberts University*
| Jun 2016 -- Feb 2017
| Led machining efforts for the manufacturing of our team’s competition design
| Worked with CAM software and CNC mills to automate precision manufacturing processes

| **Team Captain**
| *FIRST Robotics Competition Team 3593*
| Aug 2015 -- Apr 2016
| Problem-solved to meet challenges while remaining cost-effective and within design constraints
| Set goals and directed projects, from fundraising to robot design
| Gained extensive machining and assembly experience, totaling well over 300 hours

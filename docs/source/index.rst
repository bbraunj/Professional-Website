My name is Josh Braun, and I am currently a Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering
Graduate Student with a passion for software-based solutions.

Experience in Software Engineering experience includes 2 1/2 yrs as a
year-round Software Engineering Intern at Sandia National Laboratories,
personal software projects, and a continuous learning mindset, exploring
technologies like Kubernetes, Machine Learning, and Javascript.

Experience in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering includes Graduate coursework,
3 industry-sponsored projects, and a Master's Thesis focused on a small-scale
turbojet engine.
